### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there!

I'm Kenneth Nguyen, a 3rd year CS student at UC San Diego (June 2026).

### ðŸ’» **Experience**
This summer, I'll be working at Coinbase under the Proofing & Regulatory team, and this upcoming fall I'll be joining Google working as a Site Reliability Developer. Previously, I worked on [Homes.com](https://www.homes.com) development at CoStar Group, [Unsteady Pressure Sensitive Paint](https://www.nasa.gov/unsteady-pressure-sensitive-paint/) & an internal data platform at NASA, taught a [ASIC design class at MIT](https://beaverworks.ll.mit.edu/CMS/bw/bwsi_course_basics), and did full-stack work at two startups. I'm interested in scalable data systems, infrastructure, backend systems, and startups.
